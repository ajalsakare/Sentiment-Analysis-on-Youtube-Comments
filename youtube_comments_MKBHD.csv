0,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Krishnendu Chowdhury,"in a world where $1000 phones are now normal, it‚Äôs refreshing to see a mid tier phone with so much attention to detail.. I am definitely not expecting it to outshine a $1000 phone, that‚Äôd be unrealistic, just need a clean experience."
1,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,david davud,"I feel that after this, the next logical step is doing a smart watch. They don't rely as much on performance but heavily on user experience so it could be decent."
2,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Mathew Blanc,"I'm still on my Pixel 2, it was a surprise to hear that the coloured notification dot is no longer common! I use it every day, it would be nice if the manufacturers brought it back before I buy my next phone, but I doubt it üòÖ"
3,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Jacob Olness,"Like you said, I think it is smart they're forging their own path on their products. Excited to see what else they come up with. Would love to see a better camera (even if it was on a more expensive ""Pro"" model) in the future but this seems like a good option. And it is neat looking, even if it isn't for me."
4,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Thanos The Mad Titan,High refresh rate mid rangers and budget phones are fantastic. I love how almost all new phones have high refresh rate now.
5,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Nima Master,The notification led was a cool feature. I miss having it on my old xperia ion. Why don't companies add it back at least using the always on display? Like some ppl turn AOD off to save battery. A little circular blinking dot at the corner (preferably you could choose the location) of the screen would do the job perfectly
6,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Nico Castillo,"Love the idea of having ""nothing"" in your set and background. All those containers and transparent items relate to the product being reviewed. Always love this kind of attention to details."
7,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Jordan Ferguson,"I almost 100 percent think they're going the smartwatch route next, imagine their design language on a watch. It's going to be so cool."
8,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Karun Bihari,"This is exactly what I was waiting for as a OnePlus fan. I totally understand Carl Pei his decision to leave OnePlus. OnePlus had my attention since the very first version and my first OnePlus is the 6T which I'm still using currently. But as most of us know, OnePlus went in a different direction which killed the original OnePlus vision. Thanks to Nothing I have my hope back for the future of real innovation and best user experience."
9,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Dan Killam,"It reminds me of my Essential phone that I loved. Both try to use novel materials and features to differentiate themselves. Hopefully they don't have the same problem that Essential had of over-promising. Their decision to stay overseas is a good sign from that perspective. Essential was killed by poor signal quality in North America, mostly Tmobile. It was why I had to stop using mine. I hope Nothing can continue to grow and become a real player, in a market that is becoming overly consolidated with little real competition. Also that black one looks awesome! I prefer it to the white."
10,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,DOGGO_ Woo,"For me, I would say that companies spend way too much on design now days, and not much on actually making the user experience good. This seems very similar to that. Like, what purpose can those 900 leds serve that one adjustable flash light couldn't? Who actually puts their phone screen towards table?"
11,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,ÍπÄÏ†úÏù¥Îì†üá∞üá∑,Gotta admit that the nothing phone is suprisingly looking very modern and futuristic in contribution to the iPhone camera design with of course the additional lights at the back of the phone as MKHBD has discussed before.
12,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Engi1729,I really missed the notification LEDs when I switched to a phone without them. I so wish a company would release an update to use the always on lock screen functionality to have a few pixels in the corner emulating a blinking LED.
13,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Callum Wrigley,This man's cinematography is on another level and still amazes me every video! Keep up this quality content!
14,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Prazzo123,I love how Marques does no gimmicks and just talks. His analysis and cool voice is enough here - no need for fancy stuff.
15,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Joseph Morgan,"I sure would love the camera on my 6P to be put into this phone in every other way. Much better design, better size, symmetrical bezels, flat screen, brighter screen, faster charging, and I'd imagine it doesn't get nearly as hot as the Pixel does in general use."
16,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Blake Warford,"Not going to lie, I seriously love this. To have a phone that sleek looking at that price range, if I were to show this to my buddies and have them guess the price, I guarantee it wouldn't be 399. I was concerned around the performance of the phone since it seems a lot of the cost went into design and materials, but this is a GREAT consumer product. I think if Nothing can expand that name and produce this on a bigger scale, it would be a hit amongst the regular consumer market"
17,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,Scott Robinson,"Seems like a decent phone. 
Decent specs, decent functionality, some interesting quirks and gimmicks that might appeal to some people. 
And a fairly good price. "
18,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,me me,"i watched a video of this phone, hyping it up crazily when this video basically made that entire video a myth. it was saying about how the lights would be programmable, how you could connect to their satellite internet and more and now it doesnt even come with a charger. how you said about the lights being only at the back, made me realize that how useless the gimmick is too, esp since putting your phone screen down is a fast way to destroy your screen so few people, actually does it.  sadly, there's also no mention of the vibrations or the maximum volume anywhere which is very important for older people and people who like their phones on silent."
19,1,Nothing Phone (1) Review: Seeing Through the Hype!,2022-07-15,2771251,129382,raz 9800,"this is actually the first android phones that i'd consider buying, love the design and that beautiful back, too bad the glyph interface isnt very customizable"

24,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,BeerLicious,"That webcam system is actually a thing of beauty. I've been critical both for Android & iOS a lot but i always say , iOS brings you up something so good & stable that you can't hate it at all. Samsung been their close competitors is doing great but system optimisations of apple are just on another level ."
25,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Taylor Rodieck,I‚Äôm so excited for this update. More customization is always welcome!
26,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Eric Bonow,Live objects seems incredible. That kind of image cropping is really quick and is the kind of thing that 95% of people wouldn't be able to do on their own. The processing effect is really clean. Hats off to their design and development teams on baking in a pretty complex operation into such an intuitive way.
27,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,[C H E R R Y]-T[A]P Me!! To Have [S]EX With Me,"The ""virtual top-down view"" and the ""Live Image"" features are hella impressive, close to being magic. Well done, Apple."

29,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,The_Phat_Man,"I need that camera continuity/desk view feature. It would help me a lot. I've also installed iOS 16 on my phone and it runs pretty well. Does get pretty warm sometimes when I'm using new features so I hope that gets ironed out. All in all, I love the new look to the lock screen and can't really find anything wrong other than the temperature thing. I've also only had it for like a week so I'll edit this if this opinion changes drastically."
30,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Jacob Timothy,"I don't usually comment, but I have watched your content for 3-4 years consistently. Every single video is A-1. Perfect. You and your team are incredibly talented and ultra-content creators."
31,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Serie26,The feature I like the most is the ability to sort music playlists on the phone itself.  Another 15 years and we might be able to rename songs on the phone.
32,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Anthony Williams,"I personally would have loved to see support for voice/audio messages. It's so annoying that they A.) Don't allow for the user to scroll through the audio or speed it up by 1.5x, 2.0x, etc. and B.) The screen will often time out, causing the need to start it over from the beginning. Super frustrating, especially for those people who don't understand the concept of calling if your audio message will exceed a minute or more lol."
33,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Recuerdo Hattem Reyes,"Despite being an avid and an extreme Android (Samsung) user, I have a large and uncountable level of respect towards Apples' simplicity and eco-friendliness in their systems, especially with these added features in IOS 16, it never fails to impress and to make love to such device, I wished i had two phones, but for now ill stick to one but have a MASSIVELY HUGE respect towards Apple."
34,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Yoien,"the virtual top down view would be very useful for class, i love this magic. and im not the type of person to customize home screen widgets, but im definitely have 8 lock screens with this new update."
35,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Juan Pereyra,The continuity camera feature was something I‚Äôve been hoping for üôåüèº
36,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,headspug,"I wonder if Apple will ever introduce the most basic Android functions, such as 'pin to screen' or simply having a small YouTube video playing in the corner, while having the rest of the screen available for other tasks."
37,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Benjamin Barnett,"That intro thoüòç!!! You and the team keep elevating Marques, that looked like it belongs in the Apple event!"
38,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,NiklasWag,"great video, as always! Still got a couple of questions about continuity camera:
1. Do you need the Belkin mount? If not: how far aways can the phone be from the Mac?
2. Does the topdown mode only work with iPhones with an ultra-wide or is it just ""not that good"" on iPhone 8, X, Xs?3. Can you manually change between the phones cameras or is it locked to the 1x camera?"
39,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Rorisang Monaledi,'Live Activities' is hands-down my favourite new feature. I hope developers really buy into and support this feature and it doesn't have wasted potential like the touchbar.
40,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,flibbittygibbitt,That part about the center camera not being the main camera was quite a plot-twist.
41,2,iOS 16 Hands-On: Top 5 New Features!,2022-07-11,4834386,213579,Koushik Debbarma,"Unlike OnePlus with their Hasselblad venture, Xiaomi, with Leica actually made something worthy of praise."
42,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Creativepic NL,From a photographer perspective this phone is a beast! Ben from Ben‚Äôs review did a side by side compare and it‚Äôs capabilities are quite remarkable. Performance wise it feels like its up there with all of the other brands. I don‚Äôt really get why the color profiles change that much when switching cameras. Other than that: highly impressed. The bokeh with the sharpness is so nice! Nothing beats optical rollout!
43,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,scientia,"This ""hit or miss"" thing is typical in photography, I would say. Even with professional DSLRs, you still have to try a bit, know about the settings etc. to get ""hits""."
44,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Lorenzo Franchini,I got to a point where I just watch Marques' videos even if I'm not interested in the subject. His vibe and the way he talks about things are so enjoyable and comforting that I always hope there's a new video every time I have my lunch break :)
45,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Abdultajj,"This guys is really the best. I have never seen anyone review a camera of a phone like that. Precise, concise with needed details. Keep it up MKBHD!"
46,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Smithson52,Now all Xiaomi needs to do is start pushing out consistent software and security updates. That's the only thing they are lacking right now. Killer phone regardless!
47,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Perfugium,"10:05 marques is just too good a reviewer that he's even reviewing the phone for the people who do ""super weird creepy zoomed in videos"""
48,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,BODCARE,Love the leather Matt finish on the back. Makes a classy look all round. Can't help but think how vulnerable that large camera area would be subject to damage on desks etc.
49,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,The Codfather,Nice to see this camera has a phone in it.

51,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,delpinsky,"I've seen few comparisons in this week and maybe a weak point is the 5x zoom sensor, not really as sharp as the competitors. But perhaps it can be easily fixed via software updates. I really like this phone."
52,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,,Looking forward to this going out in the first round of the blind camera test comp!
53,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Spark Fiji,"Love this look, I had the Nokia 1020, still think it looked great plus had a good camera for the time. One of my photos was blown up and printed full page size in our local paper and the quality beat a lot of their own photos. Honor have done this round bump too. I use my camera for work every day so this phone is very tempting to try and get yet again a combo of this look, great phone, and Leica lens."
54,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,cylix1,"Impressive tech.  I have the mi 11 ultra and thinking of getting this one as a upgrade but one thing that i will miss will be the second screen on the back.
Was a cool gimmick to take selfies with the main camera and i think xiaomi was wrong not bringing it back for the 12, especially with this 1 inch camera. Would be so cool to take easy selfies with it."
55,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Barney Laurance,It seems like with the big sensor it could really use an option to stop down the lens to reduce the depth of field sometimes. The bokeh looks fine but sometimes I'd want to see close up details and distant details in focus at the same time.
56,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Nkereuwem Ezekiel,I've seen several reviews of the 12S Ultra but this is the one I was looking forward to. Satisfied now. Great phone.
57,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Chris Henderson,"Absolutely dug this video.  Happy to see the strides Xaomi is making.  Question.  Is tesla the apple of EVs?  And after the EU lightning cable decision and Tesla's move to support non Teslas at superchargers, does that mean it is a bad thing?  I mean it could be DisplayPort vs Thunderbolt 2 all over again...  same port shape, WAY different capabilities.  Thoughts?"

59,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Indra Surya Permana,it's amazing to watch such technology inside Xiaomi 12S Ultra. and it's way more amazing how you could find its main selling point's Bug even when it isn't officially coming to all market yet
60,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Sidenote,"One of the things I like about the ROG phone is that they've maintained what's made them unique through EVERY iteration of the phone. They just try to improve on what's poor, without cutting corners or going main stream. If only One coulda done the same. Huge respect to Asus for this one."
61,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,Veruux,"The display bezels are probably one of my favorite features of this phone. Just very small and even on the top and bottom of the phone, no notch or camera hole. I really wish more companies would do it like this."
62,3,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2022-07-07,2312010,103328,tripleAAA,Nice to see them keeping the headphone jack after the third iteration for the 5 and now the 6. You don't see a lot of these big phone companies having that extra feature on their newer phones nowadays. This will definitely work great for high audio quality headphones
63,4,ROG Phone 6 Pro Review: Daily Driver Material!,2022-07-05,2082369,97350,Ovi Wan Kenobi,"Honestly, the look of it is sick. It's my favourite one they've made by far.
This could be a great phone/tablet for media and some gaming. So many of us world from home now anyway. I bet this is awesome to watch stuff on. Would be cool if it smoothed video to 165hz!"

With an over clocked processor and RAM to keep up with it, I think it's safe to say that this phone will have even more heat to deal with than a more standard configuration. I know they have a purpose built heat spreader, but was it built to be comparable to standard configuration, or exceed it."

71,4,ROG Phone 6 Pro Review: Daily Driver Material!,2022-07-05,2082369,97350,,"Always amazing videos. But as a gamer myself, I just don‚Äôt see the need for such a beefy ‚Äúgaming smartphone‚Äù.

This is a solid pickup.. It should be a workhorse for a solid 3-4 years too. I think this is the most exciting Android out, nothing but love.. they listened to us."

This Ford F-150 is the first of all of these to make me go, ""huh. Maybe there is a little something to how things have been done."" And to me, it looks like the single most compelling EV option for anyone and everyone that doesn't care about EVs. Which, I should add, is the only way mass adoption is ever going to become a reality as fast as we need it to be. Great coverage, Marques."

Ford has done well with this. Its marketing, execution, after sales service, parts availability, and local dealers who have been trained to repair them -> each segment seems to have come together, esp compared to other EV manufacturers. And while its price is still up there, its still acceptable for the value."

Ford will already be updating and adding features by the time all the others hit the market. It was smart to take advantage of their market leadership and not remain stagnant.

We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"

It looks/feels like what people in the 1980s imagined future phones would look like.  I feel like people will want to program the lights to do something more than just flash... like respond to music, indicate a direction to go, etc. Sometimes we can't have our full attention on a phone so having a simple elegant indicator that is easy to interpret just by glancing rather than reading carefully declutters a lot of our visual space."

They did this for marketing, making little to no profit on their first phone made people buy it because of the great value and love it for that reason, and they went in with the same mentality on newer phones even if they didnt follow the same strategy. So for me, that is the key thing that will flip me into buying this phone or not. Do i get a great phone for a great value, or not. Price will be the deciding faction for Nothing phone (1)"
129,8,The Nothing Phone LOOKS Different,2022-06-21,7944567,307137,shantanu bopardikar,"Well after using a smartphone for the last 3 years, what I think is that all the cool features that any company brings to the table, or any modifications/customizations they do, don't grab the same attention after a certain period of time. We always tend to fall back to the basic usage of the phone ( although the term basic can vary from person to person ) the point here is, all we want is a phone with good hardware and software quality but in cheaper cost, only if OEM's try to reduce the profit per phone ratio and actually build phones for users maybe it can help both the customer as well as the company.

If it's going to be way more expensive and less capable than the current generation high end phones the design and uniqueness will not suffice sadly. "

I know there were a lot of complaints about how it wasn't able to overlay over your entire field of vision like a video game HUD, but I think it was smart to not design it like that. Having it just be a little rectangle in the corner of your vision made it very clear where your attention was since you'd see the user staring at the Glass display instead of straight ahead."

The first film they shot with it was ""Russian Ark"" (look it up on Wiki) in 2001, the first full length feature film to be shot in one take which wasn't really possible with traditional film as these rolls only covered 45 minutes (hence the exchange of film rolls in cinemas in the middle of the film). Hard drives back then were still so tiny that they had to connect a lot of them and had a guy with a ""hard drive backpack"" run behind the cameraman while he was shooting. But it worked, my buddy collected investor money, moved from Germany to L.A. only to see his project die slowly.

The car was actually really well received and people loved it, but GM created it to show how crap electric cars are. So when customers had a completely different reaction to what they expected, they bought all the cars back and destroyed them in fear that it would create a market shift towards EVs."

I don't think a typical air user will get much value out of a better processor, and will likely get more value out of a higher-spec'd M1 than a baseline M2. Personally, I think price point makes this an overall worse product than the M1, but some great upgrades for those with more money than me lol"

Midnight color is the best of them all and now that you mention it had a touch of blue, even better. Forget about silver and space grey. Those two colors are tired. If you pass on midnight go for starlight. Too bad Apple did not also make bright colors like the iMac"

192,11,WWDC 2022 Impressions: M2 Macs and iOS 16?!,2022-06-06,4757423,290112,Cade Capper,"I think Apple is finally allowing more customization of features like the lock screen and home screen because the way people use their devices is evolving. When the first iPhone/iOS was released, the smartphone market at the time was full of devices that were complicated and difficult to use. iPhone's biggest drawing point was that it was incredibly simple to use -- ""it just works."" Apple's kept that philosophy for years, but I think they're realizing that it's sort of becoming obsolete. Not many people need smartphones that are super simple to use anymore because basically everyone knows how to use a smartphone, so adding more complicated features like widgets on the home and lock screens doesn't scare people away by making the device too hard to use."

To me it seemed incredibly soft focused and slightly worse than the built-in camera. Allowing us to use the iPhone as a high res webcam is an awesome idea. Using only a small portion of the camera's sensor so they can have Desk View and Center Stage, means we get a more interactive camera, but at the same horrible resolution and soft focus that we've been complaining about for a while."

Sony Xperia 1 IV!,2022-05-23,2289175,96601,SmudgeOfficialUK,"I have been playing around with AI art a bit and I think the technology will replace a lot of things. I don't think it will replace the culture of art though. I watch a lot of artists on Youtube and the reason I like it is because of the skill. When I watch someone draw a picture perfect image it makes me excited, and that is what gives it value. I don't look at my printer in the same way."

We're not at peak smartphones in a long term, but short term? Maybe yes. Adding that up to the chip crises, maybe Apple will take this context to do what they do best: not new tech, but marketing. If they, for example, decide NOT to launch the basic iPhone, they'd have the perfect excuse for that: a new Apple, that values the environment, that cares about the planet, and so on. We know that in a capitalist world, scarcity (or at least the illusion thereof) is what builds value. So what would make the actual new iPhone more valuable? The lack of a new, but lower-tier one.

I love my 11, couldn't point out a fault in it, there's no major features I feel as though I'm missing out on - believe it on not apple, a big ass magnet isn't the selling point you really think it is.

I'd really like to know just how long and when planning starts from start to launch date with new phones. For example, I wonder, what stage is the iPhone 14 in? Is it being tested? Is it being mass produced? And once the 14 gets into the market when does the 15 get started or I bet you it already has started.
Please do a video on this I'm really curious. All the best.

299,16,What Happens When the iPhone Peaks?,2022-04-29,3891738,150439,Andy Lund,"Smartphones were exciting about ten years ago. But let's face it, every phone since the first iPhone has had incremental upgrades. Remember the first iPhone only had 2G. The second one had 3G. The next big change was the design of the iPhone 4 in 2010.

The iPhone 5 in 2012 brought a bigger screen. The iPhone 6 was another design refresh. The next big change outside the yearly chip upgrades was the iPhone X which was a big design upgrade and came with FaceID.

The iPhone 12 saw a move back to the design language of the iPhone 4 & 5. So really there has been mostly incremental change since the first iPhone!

The only issue at all was the fingerprint sensor sometimes not registering a print at the beginning but with every update it's gotten a little better. Now it works fine. It's an optical sensor so it's never going to be instantaneous like an ultrasonic, you need to leave your finger on the screen for a little bit. I'd like if the phone had face unlock just because I like that feature. Other than that I love this phone. Use it every day all day and it's been solid for me.

I don't like fingerprint and auto brightness so I was glad to hear these were the larger complaints.  Very happy that the transfer from an LG G7 ThinQ to Pixel 6 was fairy easy.  All my data transferred and most of the apps.  I would've stuck with LG because I like how customizable they were, user friendly, reliable, but are no longer being made and support for calling is running out.

I still regularly see it getting updates from Valve. I suspect they would mostly be security related (keeping certs up to date and updating kernal etc) but they put in the effort to keep it running, and let you build your own with explicit Raspberry Pi support. It has seen UI and usability improvements too though not as recently, but still well after it went out of production. Out of production now and commercially non viable to produce at the time of it's creation? Yeah. But also, probably ahead of it's time.

I can tell you that if you are very worried about battery health, long term, use the slowest charger you can and don‚Äôt use your phone while charging. Charging solutions are improving but lithium batteries have not changed much. I use the 5 watt charger still on a timed plug overnight. My iPhone 13 Pro‚Äôs battery health is at 99% still, I have had it since launch. I actually tested this theory with my iPhone 12, I used the 20 watt charger instead and sometimes wireless charging, both of which cause more heat. I saw much more battery degradation in the same time period. I am super interested in what some of these companies have done the last several years and ultimately I think some developing technologies that are on the horizon will solve this issue entirely."

Excellent example of being actually non biased and open to being honest about the product. Very helpful in making sure people don't make the ridiculous decision to buy something that is way way way below the standard. I have been a Mac fan for the last 13 years now and most of what I have experienced with Apple has been stellar. There are the obvious things to hate about the company Apple which I hate just as much as anyone. For the most part, when the products are weighed in the balances the upside outbalances the down side. In regards to this monitor, the downsides totally outbalance any upside hands down!! I had already placed the order for the Apple Studio Display to pick up the next day in Toronto on April 16 when I was browsing around and kept running into other review comparisons that showed clearly to avoid this piece of garbage. I simply cancelled the Apply order. After buying a Samsung on the 16th that I found barely used on Kijiji, spending a lot less money and getting a 5X bang for the buck over the Apple, I then also saw this review today. This one completely seals the deal 100% about NOT buying the Apple Studio Display and I hope that anyone who has purchased one of these returns it asap. Marques is one of the best out there period and I only just heard of him this morning. I just subscribed today and wish I would have seen his youtube well before this. Thank-you!"

The other day I was having a discussion with my friend and ultimately my gripe with apple is that in my view, they come off as having a mentality of "" we know better than you"". They have this habit which I really dislike from them and other companies where they create a problem and then sell you the fix to the problem (instead of focusing on the problem itself). Like with the cord; I think the idea of magsafe is amazing. I wish all my products would have some form of device where it allows ease of removing and the protection of it as well. So the fact that they would pull this sort of stunt and say oh hey, we have a tool for it just blows my mind. Terrible design decision and do not think for a moment that they ""had"" to do it this way. They have a massive R&D budget, they damn well could have figure out another way of doing this without the need of some tool."

431,23,Does Fast Charging ACTUALLY Ruin Your Battery?,2022-03-25,4166945,221600,Chris Mirchandani,"Great presentation and I agree with the fails on no mini-led, no ProMotion, power cord not removable, stand not upgradable, poor quality web cam, and no Face ID given it has a A13 chip even if it was used for 2FA. I also think they missed an opportunity to have multiple monitors work in tandem with audio and possibly even the web cam. This is the company that comes up with great useful features, although neglects a lot of them, and this crazy expensive monitor really only has some trivial additions. It's like the team that designed the Studio Display was designing the old MBP which took away man things Pros, and frankly even general users, wanted while not long ago a different team created the new MBP with things Pros do want and the Studio Display team ignored it all. This display is the victim of the same thing that gave us the Touch Bar. i.e. Apple ignored it, then had to come up with something to say they weren't ignoring the Mac, look the new MBP, it's all the things that no one asked for or wanted in a MBP. Yes I'm aware that had some exaggeration. However, I equate these things to the one button mouse desuional logic which is like a virus Apple can't cure, it always pops up somewhere. Frankly $400 for a single not uncommon function is where Apple shows itself as a greedy corporation like that $19 display cleaning cloth or the $1000 stand. Yes people pay for elegant designs, but there is a point when you're just milking customers because you can. If the stand had more of the functionality of RA-HS3111, which lets you control the position of a monitor in 3 dimensions independently, but they gave it Apple style and the one thing missing, fine tune height adjustment, I'd be OK with $400 - $550. There is actually another thing missing from the RA-HS3111, a quick release at the VESA connection to the monitor, but I've given up on Apple making monitors or AIOs with removal stands."

One comment regarding the display - I bought the Dell display you mentioned, as well as the LG Ultrafine. I was particularly excited about the Dell, since it had great reviews, and was so cheap. The Dell was fine for general purpose use, but the resolution of text was much worse than my Macbook Pro - not even comparable. The LG was slightly better for text, but still not as good as my Macbook pro display. I tried several other displays and could not find anything that had the resolution of my macbook, specifically for text. I'm doing a tech startup, so I spend a ton of time on documents, code editors, UX design etc. I was a bit hesitant getting the Studio display, but was cautiously optimistic. I've had it for a couple days now, and I can say this is the only display that is almost as good as my macbook pro display. The webcam is subpar, as you pointed out, and the shouldn't be charging $400 for the height adjustable piece. The bezel around the display should be thinner, but overall, I love it. Finally have something cheaper than the incredible XDR, which is overkill for me. Thanks for your great reviews."

You're right - for most people this machine will probably be overkill but that is still fine.  For others there are the larger Macs or PCs.

I was interested in buying an ipad earlier this year and the most affordable one that could cater my needs was the 2020 ipad air with A14. But it had only 64 gb storage. So I had to pay an extra amount for the 256 gb one which is the only other option. But with a very slightly more amount I could get an ipad pro with M1 chip and 128 gb storage. I was very convinced for that product but then I realised that in no time I had gone way too over my budget so I decided to wait for the new ipad air launch so that the old one gets cheaper. But now I am more confused.

They might buy this M1 model purely for the colors, because, if they were fine with the Air they wouldn‚Äôt even need any of the extra power of the M1. Sometimes the simplest explanation is the best.

Because in my head I would just get an ipad with lowest possible storage, and then use USB flash drives or other ways of offloading files, deleting and redownloading big apps since I tend to play a game or use an app for a while and then not use it for a chunk of time... and be totally fine with that.

That is nice. Previously, the lack of software updates was what made me move away from android and move to iOS. Back then when I had the Note 8, I wanted to use a feature in an app but couldn't because I had to update to the latest android software, and I COULD NOT update it with my Note 8! A phone that cost me nearly $1000 at the time, and within 2 years I could not use some features that I wanted to use because I could not upgrade the software of the phone no more. I thought that was ridiculous, and thus just moved to iPhone. "

Coming from a note 10+, it isn't that huge of a difference for me, but I can definitely tell it's more refined. I love the heft that the phone has. I expect a large phone to have weight to it. Makes it feel solid and like it was built well. I especially love the camera. With the matte black finish on the back, having each individual camera lens bump out looks way more clean to me than having a big solid brick in the corner, which made the s21 line feel really top heavy when holding it (my cousin had one so that's how I have a frame of reference).

I love the route that Google is going with the Pixel, but I also love the Note and the S-Pen. I will give it some time to see what tech Samsung has implemented in the S22 Ultra to determine if this phone is as intelligent if not more than the Pixel. Everyones use case is different and I could care less about the camera. The fact that Samsung now has 4 years of Andriod updates and 5 years of security updates makes it that much harder to switch to Pixel."

Finally bought the Oneplus 6 and felt in love with the brand. A year later I bought the Oneplus 7 pro full specs at launch for the amazing screen it had at the time. It's still my favorite smartphone ever since 2019 and I still think it's the best phone they did. The new ones are a bit boring and it's sad because I love oxygenOS so much.."

That's not to mention that I can't imagine having to go back to a hole punch display. Sure on paper newer phones and processors have better performance but in real world use I can still play any game maxed out also games and media look great on this notchless display, and as a bonus I don't have the excessive heat issues of newer more powerful chips.

The oxygen OS is something of a big deal for me in op phones. If they remove it from the international variant I'll consider op dead to me. Really miss the old vibe op used to provide at the time of every launching event.

Dash charge and oxygenOS were the best features, plus it had great specs for the price when 128GB storage and 8GB RAM were rare, and the headphone jack was nice even though I went to bluetooth headphones early. None of the reasons I chose that phone apply to their newer models, and with the Samsung OneUI looking nicer than ever and honestly even iOS making some steps in the right direction, there's more and more reason to go for one of the major players next time round"
613,36,Galaxy S22 Impressions: 1 Real Downgrade!,2022-02-09,2460671,96610,Saverio,"I bought my OP6 when it launched and used it for more than a year without any problem. Nice phone for a very nice price considering everything it came with. While crossing the US (phone originally from Europe) the phone decided it was time to update the OS without requesting any confirmation from the user. Well that update COMPLETELY BRICKED the phone for days without a way of resetting the device. Apparently OxygenOS updates are not interchangeable if you are coming from a different continent (maybe they are today, idk). The very next day I was supposed to cross 300 miles of desert and if that had happened one day later than it did I would have been stranded in the middle of nowhere without a GPS. After trying to reset the device for hours (I lost a lot of photos and videos) I decided to go the safe way by buying an iPhone. Best decision ever. Couple years later and OP released a statement that customers' data had been stolen by hackers since 2014!!! What did OP do about it? NOTHING they just stopped replying to emails requesting more information about what had happened. OP has been going down the toilet since the OP7. The company completely changed and decided to settle."
614,36,Galaxy S22 Impressions: 1 Real Downgrade!,2022-02-09,2460671,96610,Christopher Flores,Thanks for the review! I've been curious about the new phone because I was debating of sticking with the brand or moving on (currently I'm with my OnePlus 7T) since no matter where I look I find that almost everyone still chooses the Apple brand to be the best and its hard to find a good Android that can go without any bugs and issues which OnePlus as of lately as well has been going through. Hopefully theres still something that will stand out. Have they converted a us price yet as of now with this phone?
615,37,An Announcement!,2022-02-01,2718360,134575,mikk-02,I bought 7T Pro last July 2019 and still loves it even though I bought S21 Ultra last Feb 2020. I can't leave the full screen view and 5G is not really a big deal right now. I still cant see myself not using my 7t Pro for about 2 years from now.

The organizers set up a group chat over iMessage to give all the participants updates about the activities that would take place over 3 days. Out of over 20 participants from chapters all over the country, I was the only one with an Android phone. I missed out on a lot of the features in the chat and trying to text back was a nightmare. The person I got assigned as a roommate was kind enough to pass over some of the information that was being discussed, but I can't emphasize how dystopian and isolating it felt to be there with all these people while feeling like I was outside of a bubble.

In many other places, particularly the UK where I am from, third party messaging services made SMS practically obsolete for personal messaging, starting even before smartphones came along.

I'm impressed you got a 16"" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)"

I definitely think it should go in a different direction than typical app reviews, but you could make it like a contest where people submit their favorite apps and you rank your personal favorites or you could just choose a category of app and then REALLY try to home in on the very BEST app in category X.

The display is a bit too big to be handled with one hand but is amazing for content consumption. Battery life is exceptional. The plastic back is going in a 10 dollar case anyway.

The big difference here is that the s21 FE has a bigger screen and also a snapdragon processor instead of the exynos one, which makes the phone superior this way. The only negative might be that the camera is potentially less good for the FE, but that seems like a good tradeoff for me personally."

What made the s20 FE awesome was that it performed as good as the S20 and plus even though it was cheaper.

The finger print reader actually worked really well even when my hand was extremely shriveled from washing dishes. Lastly, yes the price may be a little on the high side, but most people will never pay that regular price. I traded in my regular s20, and got the s21 fe for free as an upgrade. Great deal.

That way the phone's won't be disqualified if they happen to present one scene uncharacteristically worse than usual (or the other phone does uncharacteristically well.) This method introduces bias simply due to the order the pictures are in (for example, if you had done the second photo first, we would probably have different results.)"

For 4 semesters during 2006-2008 I was an electrical engineering co-op student at Sony Ericsson (working on/off for a semester instead of going to school). I got to know the camera team pretty well, and I ended up spending most of my time working for them. I took thousands of comparison photos across tons of prototype modules and phones just like this test, and every time we asked folks outside the team what their favorite photos were in a comparison, they always chose the bright, saturated ones. Funny to see how some things don't change."

I was surprised the S21 Ultra was knocked out in the 2nd round. I've been super impressed with it since it came out. But I think lots of people focus on one or two things to decide whether or not they like a photo and it's not necessarily the best from a photography perspective every time."

Pixel 6 went to the extreme this year and makes the photos too bright exposing too much from the shadows and darker areas making them look unrealistic. Luckily there are the sliders to make the photo the way I want it, but it's annoying to change those every time I take a photo. I wish they would implement a way to have the settings saved permanently."

I hope we start to see more designs."
803,46,Smartphone Awards 2021!,2021-12-22,4972358,205924,Px4FGU23,"Team Little Fold for sure. Use it folded for abbreviated interactions (sending a text, checking a quick email, answering a call) and unfolded or semi-folded for extended interaction (sending an email, taking a video call, playing a game). Personally, I want the phone as small as possible for those abbreviated interactions (i.e. optimized for one handed use and pocket-ability), but big enough unfolded so the more sophisticated interactions don't suffer from lack of screen size. This device seems like a really great balance. Hope one like this hits the US markets soon. Thanks for the video."

809,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,SolarBurn,"The smaller form factor is definitely more usable than the unwieldly Fold 3.
They're using the same Qualcomm SM8350 Snapdragon 888 5G + Adreno 660, so playing games shouldn't be an issue.

No chin, no bigger side bezels, it looks like a phone I would use, even if it wasn‚Äôt foldable. And the size, having an iPhone 12 mini I appreciate the size, which feels natural, feels just fine."
813,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,4Eva Erk,I just traded in my s21 ultra for the fold 3 and it's amazing.. it allows me to pick and choose when I want to immerse myself in content. When I'm out I use the outta display which is fine for me to check what I need and fire off a text. I'm used to the smallness of it and that inner display is just killer
814,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,Peter Rullmann,"Kudos to Oppo! I hope others will follow.
How about going even shorter to a 9:16 outer display?

817,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,John McEwan,"I've never really been caught by the folding phone concept. I always thought that it is too early in a technological sense. However, this really catches my eye. I recently got the Sony Xperia 1 iii (which I love), but if I hadn't, I might have very well considered this."
818,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,Abhishek Sukumar,This is probably the first folding phone that didn't look weird to me and that makes me excited. I feel the small adjustments that makes the front screen look and feel like a proper phone and the inner screen a reasonably sized yet very usable tablet are some solid improvements and will convince more people that this is how phones are going to be as we move forward.
819,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,Rowen Chumacera,"As with any other folding phones available right now, the usability of that screen is still up to the developers of the apps people use. Android phones still have a huge fragmentation problem‚Äîone platform trying to adapt, including its apps, to a variety of hardware configurations. Most developers don‚Äôt really want to bother with that because it means they‚Äôd have to make changes (could be huge ones) to their software for phones that won‚Äôt be used by many people."

821,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,zook79,"This video makes me think of the painted portraits people use to have to sit through for hours before photography was accessible. The folks requested a portrait and it was up to the artist to render the ideal image of that person even if it didn't reflect reality. If you look up different portraits of famous people from pre-1800s, portraits of the same person can look completely different depending on the artist. Same with sculptures. I think choice is most important here; give us the choice of what style we want our pictures in, whether it's completely raw or heavily edited."

Never realized before now how crazy 'advanced' smartphone photo processing became. Editing apps are perfectly fine, but photo editing should not be automatic and hidden within the process of taking the photo. I prefer reality, as imperfect as it may be."
824,47,20 Questions with MrBeast!,2021-12-20,3473239,213503,Iesha D,"It's making me appreciate ""traditional"" point and shoot or DSLR photography more. At least I'll know that everything in the photo will be real. I went out to shoot landscape with my pixel 6 pro recently because I figured it would be an easier and more convenient than using my dslr. It was also a excited to try all the new cam features like motion blur. While the camera is probably good enough for taking impressive day to day photos with friends,  it lacks so much compared to a DSLR when to comes to nature photography."

826,48,The Blind Smartphone Camera Test 2021!,2021-12-17,2186333,112890,Jesaja Van Kerckhoven,"As a photographer, one of the most common things I encounter, especially with younger clients, is that they would prefer the picture (selfie) taken on their smartphone compared to the pictures I took with perfect lightning and editing. Mostly because my edit still shows them as they actually are and not how they wish to be seen. 
So I can only imagine this technology will keep moving forward because it is what people want nowadays, they don't want the real thing, they want an image that complies with today's superficial standards. I take a lot of pictures on my phone myself, but I turn all the automatic AI features off to somewhat have control. But I understand completely the need of just snapping a picture you're happy with without editing, I just feel they should remain somewhat ""Realistic"" :-)"

- Features like the Pixel ones where you can choose a good photo out of 10, are genuinely useful. Try to photograph a kid without it. The great thing about it is, you have all the dials. It doesn't lie to you or hide the details. It's just like, here, this might help, also you can use it as a short video, or not use it at all."

If the iPhone switches the whole picture over to the wide lens because thats best for the situation then I really don‚Äôt care. However, when all the crazy photoshop stuff happens with downloaded images and color adjustment for more vivid pictures that‚Äôs where I draw the line. The ability to do that should be 100% in the consumers hands not the software of the phone."

This seems to be leading us to romanticizing our memories and our appearance, especially with the cropping distractions out of our pictures like advertised on the Google Pixel 6. While I‚Äôm not too worried about it as long as a toggle is available, I still feel like we‚Äôre rapidly moving towards a society with two halves, one in the metaverse and one in reality."

Most people are not photographers, artists, or scientists. They just want documentation of their perception of the world. And in doing that, the smartphone camera is succeeding in its mission"
834,48,The Blind Smartphone Camera Test 2021!,2021-12-17,2186333,112890,Doublepulse,"I've started noticing the photo processing effect on the iPhone around the iPhone 7, and it got more significantly advance on later phones. The photos ended up being sharper and more vibrant to say the least. Everything about the subject looked refined. I don't mind the features but would love advance controls to tweak them to my liking without having to go through 3rd party applications. I'm not a fan of using 3rd party camera apps most of the time as the experience doesn't feel unified."

837,48,The Blind Smartphone Camera Test 2021!,2021-12-17,2186333,112890,JoeGnahz,Very good talk. I've already been pretty frustrated for years seeing more and more heavily edited photos all over the places. Reflecting the real world should always be the ultimate motivation of taking a photo in my opinion
838,48,The Blind Smartphone Camera Test 2021!,2021-12-17,2186333,112890,Dejoowie,"I feel like this is exactly one of those things were most people will say: ""Cool! But let me turn it off."" That example at the end of the video is an amazing one, as someone who takes most of his interesting pictures in somewhat tourist-y areas, I always hate realising that there are still a few people in the shot after I've already left, or don't get to take the shot I want because I'm in a hurry and don't have the time to wait for people to leave. In those cases, of course it would be amazing to just get a 'perfect' picture with my phone within seconds. But even though it'll be a pretty photo, and it provides a somewhat romanticized memory of that moment, it isn't what really happened. As long as there's still a toggle for all these features, preferably big and on the main screen instead of buried in a settings menu somewhere, it's a cool evolution. Even though it's somewhat scary to think what else it could be used for."

Last year, I installed an upgraded camera. Just a couple of weeks ago, I replaced my damages usb-c port. Looking forward to at least 3 more years of using this phone. Recycling your old devices is a great idea, but also remember that the most sustainable phone you can use is the one you already own. So don't buy the latest if your current phone will do and make an effort to keep your current phone running smoothly. Finally, one thing that wasn't mentioned in the video is that these phones are assembled in Chinese factories, but that Fairphone ensures fair wages and working conditions for factory workers.

The Palm Pre was suppose to be the iPhone killer. Their Web OS was actually brilliant but lacked any apps or App Store. I had this phone right before my first iPhone. It was the closet thing to an iPhone I was able to achieve at the time. Still a great phone. Pebble/organic design, compact, had a mirror on the back for selfies after you slid the screen up. It was shown in the TV show Heros as ‚Äúthe it phone‚Äù. Let‚Äôs not forget their CREEPY commercial though. Watch that with the lights on. It def had major flaws too. Sharp edge by the keyboard that would slice any finger, tiny tiny buttons, small screen (I didn‚Äôt mind then), and no store or processing power.

I do a lot of mirrorless photography so sometimes people ask me what phone they should get for the best photo quality. I usually tell them that we're now in the post-hardware-specs era where it doesn't really matter that much what the sensor is actually outputting, it only matters what the software then does with this image. If an image looks more appealing at first glance in a side-by-side comparison it's not because the sensor has some crazy stats that make the image look better, it's usually just because the processing adapts the colours and details to look more like whatever patterns some neural network has extracted from a huge dataset of aesthetically pleasing professionally edited images."

I feel like I'm the only one who can't stand silicone tip earbuds even though they're spreading everywhere. With the Airpods pro I thought that every company had moved over to silicone tip only earbuds and I had to stick with my older AirPods. Thankfully with the Gen 3 that isnt an issue anymore although I would like to see more companies have more options for different people. I'm the odd one in my family where my ear can only comfortably fit the hard plastic type and I have no problem wearing them, unlike silicone tips where they immediately fall out within 30 seconds."

Somehow, Apple's ones are what I had been looking out for (even though they are also expensive, seesh) and I'm glad I waited long enough to not buy the gen 1 airpods. I'm currently watching reviews because I have 80% made up my mind to buy them v soon and I prefer hard-tips (not for long hours of use perhaps) over silicon ones because they don't give off that 'suffocating' feeling inside my ears and also I can still hear ambient sounds when outside without really being too anxious.

He is always very clear in explaining features and the tech behind it. I am surprised no reviewer has mentioned the poor video calling quality of this phone. I have the Pixel 6 Pro, and WhatsApp video calling is horrible. Just like the previous commenter, the viewfinder is very noisy in low light - video calling with WhatsApp is just unacceptable (very zoomed in a faded out). There  are hundreds of users just like me with same issue and google keep passing the blame to the app developer.  Even Google's own Duo app has the issue with a lot of noise. Coming from a Pixel 3XL, this feels like a downgrade. There are some articles online suggesting a fix with the December update, which now has been halted till late January. I don't think I can wait that long, since I will miss my return period.... Always been a fan of the Pixel brand, but this experience has changed my stand.

What I love about Rivian is that it has interesting gimmicks like Tesla does but in areas where it makes sense. The different key fobs with one being an activity bracelet similar to Land Rovers, the many cargo compartments including the gear tunnel which also doubles as a bench, it has its own version of sentry mode which is one of the only Tesla gimmicks I actually care for, a rechargeable portable speaker, a rechargeable portable flashlight, a built in air compressor, many household charge ports in the frunk and cargo bed, and the security cable for having a bicycle in the rear. No useless garbage like a steering yoke that is in there because the narcissist CEO feels like having it there even if many of his customers hate it, or a completely useless smart summons where the car moves like a confused snail, takes forever for the car to get to you at which point I'd rather just get the stupid car myself. The interior looks nicer and way better put together than that of Teslas, and most of all, the car looks like it has character of which I find Teslas are completely devoid of."

1040,58,AirPods 3 Review: Easy Mode!,2021-11-02,3693570,132842,Paul Graham,"I think this does have a possible utility for the office environment. When I was working in a physical office, I would have loved to have this device for all my meetings. It doesn't take up too much space, I can review an agenda on one side, write notes, or work with my project management software on the other side. I could see it being additionally the perfect device for a business lunch, big enough for accessing and sharing key documents and information, but not as challenging as everyone with laptops or even large tablets. If they ditch the cell phone capacity, and the camera tech, focus on Microsoft productivity (lower the price) maybe they could possibly champion this as a portable business tablet... the focus being on business....though I did enjoy seeing how it can be used as a video game console.

I actually really like it. Get rid of the waterfall glass edge and go back to straight, plonk a flip3 style mini-screen on the front. The camera... honestly I'm wondering if they couldn't just move the current array in Duo 2 into the bezel where the selfie camera resides (and replace it). Don't see why you need both a front-facing and a rear facing camera array when you have two screens that can face opposing directions. Surely you can just use one screen when taking the picture?

Do this for Duo 3, keep the price the same or less and I'd be tempted.

I did not care about the camera because I rarely take pictures. I can safely say that if the first version were like this one, I would not purchase it. I also think that the $1400 price mark was too high. I bought the first phone for $1000 because I already knew that most people would not be willing to purchase a device like it. Basically, I knew that the price was going to come down. I assure anyone who wants this phone as well that the price of this one will not stay at $1400 either.

Also, I don't think the interface needs to span across both screens. The point of having two screens like this would be using two apps at once. So like a PDF or a video on one and a text editor or email on the other. Also, it would be neat to have it display two document pages at once like a book.
And of course if turned sideways one screen could become a keyboard or virtual controller. 

I like this idea, but they need to stop trying to make it something it isn't.

It just can't complete with a Note or S series because they have had 10 years to perfect the UI and feature library. It also doesn't have a great form factor and the original was difficult to use for that reason.

1050,58,AirPods 3 Review: Easy Mode!,2021-11-02,3693570,132842,Dick Kickem,"I really, really wanted to like this thing. I'm an attorney, my firm uses Surface tablets for trials and hearings, and of course we use Office for everything. OneNote in particular is something that is enormously useful. So I really liked the idea of a Surface phone with two screens, because it seems like it would be a super great productivity device that would integrate perfectly with the rest of my firm's tech ecosystem. The Surface tablets are amazing and were a huge upgrade over the iPads we used to use, for our specific use case. But all the little quality of life issues that this device has is going to keep me with Samsung. The fact that it doesn't fold flat with the screen open in particular is a huge deal breaker for me, especially because there's no outside screen. I think if there was an outside screen it wouldn't be a big deal, but if I can't have it be flat in my pocket and still be able to glance at my messages, then it's a no-go.
      "
1051,58,AirPods 3 Review: Easy Mode!,2021-11-02,3693570,132842,Jacob Kemp,"One of the things that never really clicked for me until I owned a Z Fold 3, is how much I would rely on the outside screen to do regular smartphone things. It's about the flexibility of being able to use it unfolded when I want to. There are some days that I never open up to the big screen - and that's okay.

Knowing all of this, now,  I can completely understand from a physical convenience perspective, that the Surface Duo 2 can be a pain to use, because you HAVE to open it up to use it, even if you don't want to use both screens. Combine that with the admittedly poor camera placement,  and it becomes a very cumbersome daily driver for most people. Microsoft marketed the first Duo as less of a phone replacement, and more as a business-minded tablet supplement, and I think it works fine for that, but the tradeoffs make it a difficult pill to swallow for $1500. The software bugs, though, even if the phone was otherwise perfect, is unacceptable at just about any price point these days, let alone at an eye-watering $1500.

Cheers to another great video, Marques.

Edit: An outside screen may be useful, but given the use case for Surface Duo I don't think it is necessary. Stuff like spanning apps, I find is better vertically, like scrolling a long email or web page or forcing the keyboard to the bottom screen vs attempting to span horizontally. There are a few bugs still that need to be fixed, but I have not seen the touch issues that you saw.

I am a recent convert to the apple watch (though I still prefer android phones) and I gotta say, after owning almost every Samsung TIzen watch, and 8-9 different Android Wear/Wear OS watches including the Galaxy Watch 4, I am beyond impressed. It isn't perfect, but man, it's a great watch. I actually LIKE the colors, though. I got the blue and think it looks great. To each his own, right? Thanks for another stellar review."

I think (from my informal research haha) that most people tend to hold on to their watch for a few years before upgrading, unlike the phones. So although I eagerly grab the latest iPhone each year, I'm going to be moving up to the series 7 watch from a series 4. I've got friends still rocking the 2 and 3, as well. Would be interesting if someone had some averages about how often people upgrade their watches."

I‚Äôm using XS Max now and it works absolutely fine that I find no reason to change it for a newer model and I probably keep it a few more years. Some of my friends are even still using Iphone 6 or 7 and they still functioning perfectly. Apple‚Äôs smart phones are expensive but the quality is undeniably great.

Camera performance and multitasking was worse than the 5. I switched to android and was only sucked back in with the jet black 7. After that back to android as the rounded designs and the lack of customization bugged me. Now own the 13. Fast, squared look and the widget options are great."

Also not sure if people remember this, but when the iPhone 6 came out with the latest iOS factory installed, it was completely rendered useless as a bug or something along those lines made it impossible to connect to your network provider. I remember using my iPhone 5 for a few more days after purchasing the 6 as Apple was quickly developing a software update to mediate the network connectivity issue. Not sure how widespread it was but find it funny thinking back on it now!"

I rarely just used the tablet part of the Surface Book as a standalone device and I suspect not many people did which is why Microsoft did this.

The texture of the haptic feedback feels more clicky, it's about the same size as the one on the MBP M1 14"" so you're not losing space, and you have many more customization options with it. The latter part is pretty surprising to me, since MacOS always seemed to have more and easier-to-access customization options in their settings menu. Most importantly, you can change the sensitivity of click sensors themselves, whereas on the MacBooks you can only change the sensitivity of the deep click thing you have. Apart from those differences though, it is strange using a Windows laptop but drag-and-dropping and right clicking like  MacBook, but I can't say I dislike it at all."

Like with the Surface Book, it kinda feels like the mechanics don‚Äôt exist yet to make it entirely seamless.

I can't open my Surface Book all the way on a plane tray. And in flat mode I'd use it for taking notes.

Having your own plane and flying it is pretty expensive and you wouldn't believe how expensive it is to upgrade the panel with modern screens. if you have, for example, a Cessna 177 RG, which might run you $75K, you can easily spend $75K just upgrading the screens that show how fast you're going, your altitude, etc (called ""avionics""). If your plane isn't fancy (and you don't have the budget), it's not uncommon to not upgrade it and instead use an iPad mini as the screen.

Thanks to all of the supply chain issues it was next to impossible to locate in stores. I stumbled upon one at Costco the other day and snatched it. I'm replacing my 5th gen Mini, and I'm so grateful for the redesign. My biggest complaint with any of the iPads with the home button was the aspect ratio while watching widescreen content....

The price for this iPad Mini is very off-putting. Not sure Apple makes everything affordable but wow this is expensive. IMO, I would use this for reading/online surfing and that's about it. 64 GB is nowhere near enough. So upgrading to the 256 GB takes this to another price level that is hard to justify."

I use a full-size iPad on the flight deck of the Boeing 747 I fly primarily but the aircraft I fly on the side, a King Air 250, has a much more cramped flight deck and the Mini's form factor works better for me.

You pointed out specs, comparing with specs of the other iPads and was very non-judgmental about others preferring a mini to the full size iPad.  Loved how you emphasize the importance of a buyer knowing how they intend to use the iPad, and being aware of its capabilities and limitations.  Kudos to your ability to overlook negativity, including comments of a condescending nature, projecting preference on others.  Anonymity gives many people the outlet to be unkind.  SMH"

1256,69,iPhone 13 Review: Lowkey Great!,2021-09-27,6589991,195909,APHI FPV,"The low resolution is actually something I totally envy those iPhone users for. When I want to shoot a pic, thats crisp in every detail, I'll use my big cam anyway. What counts in a phone is that it is well suited for phone-screen-sized images in practically every situation while not filling up my limited storage. And bigger pixel sizes give you one thing: A whole lot more dynamic range and low light capability (pixel binning somewhat compensates that for high res sensors, but the result is no where near a bigger pixel). So what the iPhone does is really clever: Giving you a cam that always shoots an image with great color and dynamic range while not generating tons of data, while the competition generates a lot of washed out whites and blacks with noisy unnatural colors and twice the image size. Even Sony - the very manufacturer of those camera modules - didn't really get this relation for years, always advertising a higher megapixel cam and great photos that in reality never tested even close to the iPhones own Sony Cameras. I'd rather have that 12mpx chip than half the dynamic range at 25mpx just so I can zoom in from time to time."

Now, 6 months later, I‚Äôve realized how important your thoughts were. I held back from buying the iPhone 13 pro max, a phone that I love so much, the cameras, the screen, this unbelievably smooth 120hz.. the battery, the design, this incredible blue.. All because the iPhone 14 leaks came out a week before the 13 launched and I thought oh, that‚Äôs going to be even better, let‚Äôs wait. So I held back for no reason and am unhappy with my decision, since I need the new phone and it‚Äôs Skills for my channel. And now the rumors change every week and the 14 becomes less of an improvement over the 13. I am buying the 13 pro max now and deleted all my subscriptions to leakers and rumor sites. All the leaks do is keeping us from living in the here and now. I will enjoy my new iPhone and am very excited for all of its new features. Yes the new product will always be better.

Also it showed the s pen built-in the phone. People got excited especially note fans. To me these renders get people juices flowing which is good for the company, especially when it comes to pre order's. When people see what colors the s22 ultra comes in people get even more hyped.

The range that they are offering are a lot better than the normal gas cars and since I do a couple road trips a year, I am really convinced that getting a hybrid card would save money and would be more convenient to the experience as well. As for the features, the road assistance features on the recent hybrid cars seems to have come a long way too. I‚Äôd really love to see how a hybrid card would have performed in comparison to these cars as well."

However, there's an advantage we humans have over very specific and efficient task focused robots, and that is adaptability and versatility, and in that discipline our humanoid form is actually extremely good. So, if you want a robot being able to accomplish a multitude of task, giving it a humanoid form makes a lot of sense. I mean, your roomba sure can't dust off furniture or go grocery shopping. Legs can overcome obstacles wheels cannot, hands are versatile and can use the same tools humans do.

One of the ways they could put bigger battery is by increasing the size which could make the closed size similar to the s21 plus or note 20."

My hesitation is the dust resistance and durability because I take my phone hiking a lot and I need to know that the phone can handle a little abuse. For everyday work/home stuff though, this is nice and I'm beginning to consider it as an option. Additionally, as someone who was forced to utilize DEX (work computer died while on a trip), I'm realizing the value of DEX in these phones.

It's those transitions - camera movements, effects, etc. Watching an MKBHD video is like experiencing the new Android OS for the first time - noticing all the smooth edges, rounded corners, focuses, zooms, etc. It's the epitome of what my brain likes in a video."

However, I have ignored the pixel lineup due to the fact that they are a bit expensive and I think hardware has been pretty weak in comparison to other phones. If they are so weak, they should be cheaper, I want more storage, more ram, stronger processors if I am paying extra. Anyway, I am willing to pay a bit more for longer term support if hardware is promising."

I've never had the ""high end"" buds like Samsung or Apple so I can't compare. They do have all the features of these Nothing pods plus full eq, multiple noise cancelling modes and transparency mode. I've been very satisfied for $80. I will say the noise cancelling is a bit of a pick your poison scenario; the different modes either focus on low end frequencies or high end. For me it's a little annoying because in an office setting either guys with deep voices kinda come through muted or ladies with high voices come through. It's still much better than no buds at all and they do a phenomenal job with ambient noises."

I can wear them under a helmet, under hearing protection, and they stay locked in especially with the more aggressive wings.  The Galaxy Buds+ also sound quite good (not surprising since AKG had a hand in things) and I found myself surprised at the detail they were able to deliver.  To be fair I was using some TIN Hifi earbuds prior to the Buds+ and they were very detailed but they didn't stay firmly in my ear and the wire was a pain.  Outside of my house I would be hard pressed to not be using a wireless listening device now, and it makes me chuckle because I expected a few more years to pass before wireless solutions were worth adopting."

I also heard they are finally doing always on display which would be a hella nice feature and fix the clutter of the way notifications are and maybe a software update flit add a clear all apps as opposed to having to swipe all of them closed. I am all for keeping the option for a wired connection as it still isn‚Äôt wireless if your still slapping a hockey puck on the back that has a wire and I don‚Äôt feel like changing all cables out either unless it‚Äôs usb type c which I have a crap load of. The 120hz is a must and is years behind especially when I switch to my s21 ultra which has been buttery smooth since my s20ultra. I also hope they fix apples theme or customization to make it easier and not have to go through a short cut app every time which makes customization annoying and a million extra steps which is unnecessary. I also hope that when you create a folder you can just hit add for adding apps as opposed to having to go into the library and hold and drag to the folder.

With this, I believe that it's not that easy to grab the yoke if you slip, and that's risky. Again, the horn they should have just stuck with the old method; how long will It take me to locate that button and I am also keeping my eyes on the road for some fools trying to cut me off at an exit or some dudes trying to cross when the lights are already green, that's an emergency situation, and I need my eyes on the road."

You know what you're talking about and your sentiments reflect what a lot of people are thinking about this car. The yolk is one thing, but there should be raised buttons on the back of each side of the steering wheel for the turn signals(as with some Ferraris) and the horn definitly needs to be placed in the middle again.  That is a safety issue to prevent people from lane drifting, stepping out in front of you, roundabouts, or Slackers who aren't watching the stop light turn green. "

1535,82,Pixel 6's Tensor Chip: Let's Talk!,2021-08-02,3868130,168828,Daniel Ortego,"Another great review so thanks for posting! Consideration for a departure from a wheel has been discussed since drive-by-wire was introduced. I wish I could find the source, but there‚Äôs been talk of introducing a joystick similar to what you see in some newer aircraft. So yes, designers have ‚Äòpresumably‚Äò toyed with how to implement left and right-hand (dual stick) modes. The only drawback that I found in this omitted video assessment is the costs."

The yoke steering wheel will be a learning curve like the key card, door handles, and having a giant touch screen instead of dials and buttons.  It might take more than a few days to get used to all of the new functions.  But the horn really should be where the airbag is.  But then again, with further FSD updates coming, the perceived issues may get resolved through automation."

Better window management, widgets on the homescreen, App Library, its pretty much a way to balance iOS and iPadOS.

Fine, there are few more phones with better digital processing on their picture quality such as samsung, pixel and apple. But they got something that no one has : a variable telephoto lens. Telephoto lenses are very important for portrait photography, not only it makes the face of the subject more defined and natural, it produces a more shallow depth of field. I always hate doing a photography with smartphone camera because it‚Äôs on wide lens all the time, when i switch to telephoto the quality is much worse than the main wide lens. So yeah, this phone is legit enthusiast phone"

Everyone here is already pointing out that this feels like an ad and some seem to be offended by the video. I know you're always trying out new stuff and like to experiment. I won't be overly dramatic and that this is beneath you or that you're ruining your channel, but still I want to give you my feedback that I too felt awkward watching this video. It somehow doesn't feel right / fitting to your other content. What I like most on your channel is that I can get YOUR opinion and thoughts on something that YOU like (or dislike), and respect your opinion and can very often relate. But this video makes me wonder how much of it was your opinion and how much it was just working towards ongoing sponsorship from Lenovo. Even if you have just the best intentions for your viewers, it leaves a bad taste."

That amazing battery life, great sound profile being relatively flat and their ability to stay in my ears all day without budging. These seem like a cheaper go at them minus all the sports utility too. Sound seems more on the bass heavy side though as I feel these are again intended for a more casual listening experience. Powerbeats Pro's like the Airpods Pro's carry that Pro label which I guess Apple use to determine if something gets more time put into it for sound quality and build quality because so far that's held true.

Apple uses other company's development to their full advantage by watching what new features are introduced and how well it is received.

I was torn between this and the Rivian. I like the Rivians 4 independent motors as opposed to the Lighting having 1 motor per axle, but either way its 4 wheel drive which is good enough for me. And I'm sure Ford is putting some sort of torque vectoring on there to direct more torque to the wheel that has more traction on either axle. The thing that seals it for me is the price. I can get one of these for a solid 25,000 dollars less than an R1T. That's a huge deal. 25,000 is a significant amount to a middle class dude. Love the bidirectional power too.

I have just found this video and really liked your presentation.  I fully agree about the fact the thickness of the computer is completely irrelevant as ,say, a 20 - 25 mm thick computer could have accommodated the headphone Jack and a couple of USB-A ports.

You can also put the savings towards a 27"" screen that suits your needs (maybe two). Plus, it's portable, so easy to take with you if needed (multiple offices + home).

1815,96,When Smartphones Copy Each Other!,2021-06-02,1556675,73101,Lilja Syysvaara,I actually love that they have the chin. Both visually and practically. I often have to kinda rotate the computer to access the usb ports in the back and also need some support when sticking stuff in to those ports(I change the stuff there quite often because I do photography). The chin gives you a safe place to touch the front side of hhe screen without leaving fingerprints to the glass.
1816,96,When Smartphones Copy Each Other!,2021-06-02,1556675,73101,Donald Farra,"I agree with your assessment of the new iMac design.  I also would have liked to see a all in one display with no chin, near borderless display (like the LG TV displays) and carry over of the rear interfaces including the card reader.  I can see the headphone jack due to the Bluetooth limitations, but expect it will not be used by a majority of end users.  For the folks purchasing the baseline model, they may have to purchase a thunderbolt hub later to gain more interface ports.  I expect to see such hubs/docking stations in the near future, that will attach directly to the ports in the rear, providing all the missing interfaces, including 10G ENet.  If Apple follows it's past, in regards to color schemes, we can expect the larger version of the iMac to have a graphite color.   Hopefully a matte finish.  But I do not expect to see RAM expansion slots or easy access to swap out the drive or to support third party upgrades or repair."

I LOVED the Apple Time Capsule/Base Station, it was a router + seemless backup. Granted now most people backup with iCloud, but even stripping that feature out, they still had a pretty good router that integrated well with MacOS. I'm guessing that their marketing team decided that it was a difficult market to penetrate/compete in."

I was looking into tile before apple came out with their tags but couldn‚Äôt justify it because I didn‚Äôt think enough people would have been on the app for it to be useful. I am a lot more inclined to get a ‚Äúfind my‚Äù connected device and I am glad Apple came out with the service. It sucks that Apple is getting all the business but then again this product I s a benefit to me as a consumer. Apple gets a üëç for allowing others to use the find my network but a üëé for coming out with their own product that directly competes with tile instead of using them as a partner.

The Xiaomi is actually a bit brighter at 24mm when you take into account the sensor size (though much less bright at its long end 120mm vs 200 on the RX100). Obviously the RX100 has all focal lengths between 24-200, but doesn't have an ultrawide. At 24mm the Xiaomi is roughly equivalent to an f/3.1 lens in M43. Obviously the Sony is superior in other ways, but in terms of pure light gathering they're certainly comparable at 24mm."

2144,112,Retro Tech: Flying Cars,2021-04-13,2421437,95898,6cmh3,I think the 20mp monochrome lens I had in my p20 pro was actually extremely useful as it combined with the main sensor to produce sharper images in addition to being a great camera. I'm an architecture student so I used it a lot to study shadows as it wasnt an artificial b&w photo

2148,112,Retro Tech: Flying Cars,2021-04-13,2421437,95898,Emanuel Ieremita,"The b&w camera I think actually has more resolution that it might seem. Color sensors have pixels that have filters on them for red green and blue light, and so they're arranged in blocks of 4x4 where pixels are red green and blue, and the 4th is either say a green or sometimes white. And the final image is like a mosaic of those different colors so it doesn't have that full resolution in fact. But monochrome sensors use all of the pixels to record information and you end up with a higher quality image with more information in it, compared to a color camera of the same resolution."
2149,112,Retro Tech: Flying Cars,2021-04-13,2421437,95898,Donald Alonzo,"It is a bit strange they included the monochrome sensor. Hypothetically, if it has the same focal length as the primary lens, it could be used to augment any portrait mode algorithms they're using more accurately than pulling data from the ultrawide for depth sensing purposes. This is actually something I believe Samsung is doing with the S21/S21+ and the included telephoto lens."
2150,113,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2021-04-12,3368061,119606,tearyeyed,"Exactly what I thought pre launch - the OnePlus 9 would have a price tag of what the Samsung s21 offers after its usual price cuts. Loads of people out there who wait for that drastic drop of Samsung phones to buy them but when a same OnePlus phone comes out later at the same price point...gets you fiddling with your options.
Excellent review btw."

It's my first phone(really) it's the best not as good as other one plus but the display and audio is the best.The camera is not as good as samsung phones but it's good for this price. And about the alert slider it's just MKBHD phone it's not that smooth.I can recommend this phone if you are not that into photos but except that everything is top notch and the insane battery and fast charging is amazing(literally charged my phone from 0 to 100 in 18 minutes)

2153,113,The World's Largest Smartphone Camera!,2021-04-12,3368061,119606,Aadhithya Sekar,Importance to software update needs to be addressed as an important thing in the review. 2 years for both this and the pro is unacceptable.

They are always behind in terms of security updates (the Open Betas have dropped in quality compared to years back and still usually behind) and their 1 gen or prior devices receive updates late and infrequently. Even if they finally get the updates, it's buggy. For example, the 7T series on the latest stable and Open Beta will exhibit large numbers of dropped frames in the UI after around 24 hours being on. This is from a fresh install too."

Just a note on the billion colors thing...if you say that a pixel can display 256 colors that's it, that is a 256 color screen. The way the math works is that every pixel is made of 3 independent parts, the R, the G, and the B, and EACH of them can display 256 different colors (still within their color range, respectively the Red, the Green, and the Blue). So that is how the single pixel displays all colors, because 256*256*256 = 16.7 million, while if every sub-pixel can display 1024 (10 bit), you have 1024*1024*1024 = 1 billion (roughly)."

All of the previous iPhones I‚Äôve owned had screen protectors on them almost immediately out of the box because I find that they‚Äôre easy to scratch (case in point i removed the one on my 11 Pro Max only to find new scratches a day later). Meanwhile, my 12 Pro Max had never seen a screen protector in its life and there are literally zero scratches on it, nada. I can say the same for my few month old 13 Pro Max. Never put a screen protector on, yet no scratches. I think ceramic shield has better scratch resistance, just not enough for it to move up a level on the scratch test.

With the advertised direct-storage-esque functionality of the SSD for both consoles, being able to meet that speed may be imperative for being acceptable to the system.

The sensitivity could possibly also be made dependent on the speed. So, on the one hand, you could stay in lane at high speeds and, on the other hand, maneuver in small parking lots without ever having to change your grip.That would even make for more security, because people would stick their hands to the wheel."

2696,139,2021 Tech I'm Ready For!,2020-12-31,3698295,172428,Bubble Bubble,"Here‚Äôs my humble opinion about them. I‚Äôm currently an Airpods Max owner who previously owned Sony xm4 and Bose NC 700 for a couple of days. If you want to use headphones just at home and to be free from any annoying noises, and you‚Äôre already in the Apple ecosystem, and you like to watch Dolby Atmos movies often, you won‚Äôt regret buying Airpods Max. Their ANC performance is marginally better than that of any of Sony and Bose headphones according to a measurement performed by a Korean YouTuber called ‚Äú0DiBi‚Äù. Also, another great thing about Airpods Max is their white noise level in background with no music playing is way lower than Sony‚Äôs and Bose‚Äôs. That said, if you want some headphones you like to use mostly when travelling, go get some lighter, cheaper ones like just normal Airpods or cans from Sony or Bose or whatever. Personally I couldn‚Äôt keep wearing either Sony xm4 or Bose NC 700 more than an hour due to discomfort issues with both of them, whereas I find wearing Airpods Max for several hours very comfortable despite their relatively heavyweight. Their innovative canopy headband and mesh cushions really work for me."

I‚Äôm actually A-OK with the lack of power switch. for me it‚Äôs nice because with other headphones I‚Äôve set them down and forgot to power them off, and that doesn‚Äôt happen anymore. At night I have a hanger on the back of my monitor where I store the my headphones and charge it there. Yes the case is weirdly ugly, but I can appreciate how low profile they are, versus a thicker clamshell case which takes up more space in my backpack. Of course that‚Äôs at the expense of of lacking protection for the headband, but that‚Äôs seems to be pretty sturdy.. time will tell on that one. I love the positioning of the crown dial and button. Other headsets I have to feel around to find the buttons, Apple seems to have put the dial and button in a place where it‚Äôs really easy to reach (at least for me).

Those were heavy, I could get usually an hour or two before my head started to hurt. But unlike I think a lot of review people out there I do not wear over the ear headphones casually out and about, I wear them in home or at a desk, unless I am on a plane."
2725,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,1badspartan,"Great review Marques, I now own a pair of these. I'm reading your review after I purchased them and I have to say you are pretty spot on with everything you posted.  I'm  a perpetual Apple guy but not bias.  These do sound great and for the noise cancellation alone I think they are now worth the price, I have to admit, I didn't at first.  I've listened to all types of music with them,  using the new spatial audio feature on my Apple music platform and the sound will blow you away, it's like listening in 3D.  I'm in complete agreement too with the stupid case too.  Apple I guess was going for saving the battery life and not protection of the product.  All in all, I've owned a few pairs of high end headphones and hands down these are the best I've had.  Yes I've listened to a few movies on them and the spatial audio again puts you in the movie especially with noise cancellation.  I couldn't even hear my wife yelling at me....lol!"
2726,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,CanadianBoardCrew,The fact that you can‚Äôt manually turn them off is such a turn off
2727,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,mrksts1,"IMO, needing the case to turn it off makes the whole thing a fail."
2728,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,D Chan,"Nice review. I would buy the space gray out of the five color choices, but I do prefer matte black finish. The case does look feminine by design, I would hope Apple will have a redesign of the case. "

Having watched the likes of Snazzy (audiophile), Flossy , Brian Tong, Micheal Fisher and several others who start with an open mind, I'm seriously considering the Apple  Airpod Max, having looked at the Sony mx4 and Bose 700.  They're cheaper than the BEO h95 and in the same ball park audio wise, in some areas better."

The switching between apple devices is seamless, the quality of the sound is up there with the best but man, movies in spatial audio is on another level, these are the only headphones I‚Äôve ever used that actually do surround sound. If you get a pair, check out the Mandolorian and Kong Skull island, it‚Äôs stunning!"
2735,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,Michael Barton,"It‚Äôd be great to have a pair of headphones I could use with everything.  I tried these for a couple weeks but fully working on series x and ps5 are no go‚Äôs.  They sound great everywhere else, even better than my 1000xm4.  It‚Äôs just annoying that I can‚Äôt get a pair of headphones to work with everything.  If you don‚Äôt play video games they‚Äôre absolutely worth the buy."
2736,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,Elliot Ng,"I agreed the case is pointless because the headphone is made of aluminum and it won't get scratched or damaged easily. I'm also concerned about the cups, what's the point of making them replaceable? But as long as they stay securely, I'm fine with it."
2737,140,Dear Electric Cars!,2020-12-28,3146672,176480,Esoteric Chaos,"I‚Äôm a huge Apple fan and I bought these last week on a Black Friday deal.
They sound amazing but I‚Äôm returning them.
Be warned, these things feel heavy when you were them, to the point they are distracting. And so much so that I reluctantly can‚Äôt keep them. If Apple bring out a pair of lighter AirPods max, maybe made of plastic , I‚Äôd buy them in an instant."

I unboxed them, put them on and they were at around 65% battery. I listened to music, talked on the phone, watched a few minutes of some shows that utilize Dolby so I could test Spatial audio, went through the different modes, adjusted the sound in the accessibility settings‚Ä¶you know the works. After about 2-3 hours of use, I plugged them up to the charger (out of the case). Stayed up a bit doing some work and decided to get some sleep around 2:00am on Friday, 01/08/2021. Before going to sleep I picked up the headphones to see how much charge they had and they were fully charged to 100%. I then placed them into the case so they could go into low power mode and went to bed."

I love how it‚Äôs ease to just slide the headphones in and out, I love how I don‚Äôt need to turn it on or off, I throw them in my bag and it‚Äôs fine all the time, it does protect the ear cups very well. I bought a different case on Amazon with the sleep function but I barely use it now cause the smartcase it‚Äôs much more convenient for me.

2756,141,Giving Away 24 PS5s and XBox Series X!,2020-12-25,2198775,203654,Hugo Yu,"I think the reason for its hefty price is because of how long you're going to keep it for. It's unlikely to have new models like the Sony anytime soon and it's metal and earcups are replaceable, so they need to have a bigger profit margin in order to make up for the cost that people will hold onto it for longer without replacement."

2959,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,RM 713,I have had two of them and had to send them back. The first ones had connection problems and right ear cup noise but I could reset them. I sent them back for a replacement. I got my second AirPods max and they were even worse. A different pair in a different colour. They had the same issues but won't resett. I'm getting a refund this time and refund on the apple care also. Very disappointed that Apple put out a product that doesn't match it's high price. When they worked they were great at times but the continuous problems on and off and then finally not being able to reset them made me just want a refund. They look great and are strong. The sound quality was brilliant at times and the noise cancellation the best. Another reason I didn't go for a replacement was that they wanted to send a replacement in the same colour. I wanted to make sue I didn't get the same ones back. I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN STEVE JOBS DAY. I also had all my devices on the latest upgrades of software and the headphones are also. Didn't make any difference to the annoying things happening at times with them. I tried everything to get them sorted.

You got BeoPlay H9 at $500 OR Beoplay H95 at $800 and Bowers & Wilkins PX7 at $400 and all three of them do not offer the easy connectivity that AirPods Max is offering and the sound is very similar even Apple is actually better sounding.

Sure. Did I pay only 188 bucks for it instead of 279? Also yes. And my God, airpods pro, as ugly as they are, are INCREDIBLY comfortable."

Especially when you listen to music from compressed sources like Spotify and Apple Music, the audio quality is going to suffer under the AAC codec.

3329,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,{ Ashlie },I'm sorry this has to be the largest gimmick of a product ever. And the issue is that people will buy it. I love the mesh headband and the removable/replaceable earcups and the transparent mode switch. They implemented those features nicely on this product in comparison to other headphones with the same features. But the price point does not and will never accommodate the features on this. It's not worth 500 dollars and if you get this you are literally paying for the brand and nothing else. Way better options at different price points. Could've sold this for 250-300 and I wouldn't have batted an eye. 550 tho????

3332,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,KK89,I had Marshall over ear headphones that had the magnet ear pads. They lasted quite well.. just the surface of the fake leather started coming off. But I could not find replacement ear pads. The electronics of those headphones eventually died completely and then I bought Bowers and Wilkings headphones. After 9 months of using them several hours every day the pads broke. Seams just gave up and the foam is coming out. Now the Marhasll pads didn't look nice but I could live with them. These pads exploded and needs replacement now.. and I am struggling to find any. Great.. I've struggled with finding replacement part to headphones before but this is ridiculous! Paid 300‚Ç¨ (now they sell them for 400‚Ç¨) and the pads last 9m and then you're screwed. Maybe apple will supply pads longs enough?
3333,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,5mmfreedom,"I Iove my Airpods Max. If the $100 difference in price (as of late 2021) is going to break your whole wallet, you shouldn‚Äôt be spending money on headphones to begin with. Pay your bills, buy groceries, feed your kids. But don‚Äôt act like $400 is fine, while $500 is unconscionable. The case is stupid as hell, but the listening experience and ecosystem integration is objectively better than the XM4‚Äôs in every way."

I'm bi - with attraction more towards men. If you look at the pic of the airpods max case on the apple site, as Mark said, it looks like a woman's handbag, but it also resembles a bra/bikini, a very undersized one at that. The headpieces look like breasts when inside the case, with a cleavage and some exposure at the bottom of the case. Apple knew what they were doing! I'm way past my teens now. But yeah, if I was a 14 years old virgin and saw that image along with the marketing hype on the apple site, I'd be begging my parents for them, and that's without even considering apple owning and integrating beats into its brand."

3421,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,Rob Oo,"I don't think Apple meant for the AirPods Max to be a regular everyday use product, but it was meant as a brand setting luxury item that is intentionally too expensive to create a desire for Apple brand.   If you could afford everything Apple made, then there is no longing left for the brand.   So Apple has to create a product that is highly desireable but so expensive that most people cannot get it and most people is left wanting more Apple brands.   I think that is the psychology of the Airpods Max.   It is definately an excellent product, but not worth what they are asking for it, and meant to be just out of reach so that you are left wanting something you cannot have."

There are so many really good headphones out there that sound amazing and you can spend as little as a few hundred to as much as a few thousand and all points in between.  You can get a nice little headphone amp and dac for about $200 and then get a quality headphone like the Hifiman Sundara for $350 and you spend no more than what the AirPod Max cost and the SQ will blow you away.

I mean mine phone is cheaper than these headphones. I really belive that they are great headphones but i really dont belive that they worth this price. I mean this is just too much for the ordinary non-studio headset. If this is some studio headphones than i would understand the price but they are not and i dont see the reason for this pumped price. Badicly any gaming headphones are cheaper and they have the ambient mode(i mean they need to have it because of the shootung in the game and stuff), noise canceling, great sound, you can adjust many stuff depends on your preference... Again i really think that they are great, definitly one of the best out there but its just too much to give that kind of money for the headphones. Thats just mine opinion, i wouldnt judge these who want to get these because we all like and want different things but thats just me. I honestly wont bought headphones over 200$. I thing that is great price because i font do studio music and iam not some proffesional. This is mine thought like the casual user."

My Grados are $1,200. They‚Äôre just plug-in phones, no electronics. Lots of higher end headphones are heavy. They‚Äôre admittedly meant for Apple users. For example, the spacial audio, which is a big advance, as he mentioned, right now, only works with newer iPhone and iPads. With a new aTv, it should work with Tv too. A/V phones I‚Äôve worked with professionally, generally aren‚Äôt open air. We don‚Äôt want background sound to get through the phones and disturb our editing and mastering.

Also, the XM3 and Bose QC cant be used for gaming without a separate mic, since the current bluetooth platform can only handle HD audio, but not HD voice at the same time. Do these apple ones have newer bluetooth capability for voice & audio on PC at the same time. Also, the case feature is a deal breaker. Not having an off button is super inconvenient. I work from home and I never put my Sonys in the case anymore. Thatd drive me nuts having to put them up every single time I want to turn them off. Great vid tho, thanks for your review!"

That is just straight up high quality bullshit.

First of all, the price cannot be listed as a quirk, sorry. Ask Doug DeMuro if you don't agree with me. The price is completely unjustified, which cannot exactly be said about the iPhones, iPads, Mac, hell even the Apple watch. Those are all products who have had the need, and still need, constant R&D in order to stay on top of the game.

This argument makes no sense. Professionals audio engineers aren't going to be using airpod max's for work. You are marketing these to a standard consumer audience and gauging your prices to those of professional grade products while providing no actual benefits in quality or features and we are supposed to believe that is a good deal? With that logic I could easily say my sony 1000xm4's are an even better deal, better noise cancelling and sound quality at half the price."

They do have too much treble. In some songs I needed to reduce volume to go easy on my ear drums because of too much exposure of high frequencies. These headphones definitely are good if you prefer listening to podcasts, interviews - they are crisp clear and oh yes - movies! Like in the cinema. They do brilliant job canceling the noise around you, no doubt in that. But I would not choose them for listening to the music because the high frequencies they produce will bring you headache and ear pain. Literally, when I put on QC35II on my head after Airpods Max, it just like taking Ibuprofen and coming back to normal life. Adding stupid and useless case, weight, bullkiness, no way to turn them off feature and price in the end . . . Let Tim Cook and his team wear them. Stick to any Sony and Bose. And those who already have XM3, XM4, QC35, QC35II, NC700 or Momentum 3, don't even think of changing your headset for these. Bad apple. And those who stay in a line for 12-14 weeks, do yourself a favor, buy Sony on Amazon and enjoy extra $300 for some other gadget or else. I 've been really waiting for this release and really wanted to keep 'em but just too many features that needs to be improved to be on par with the competitors."

These materials, like aluminium, act like electromagnetic shielding. This means that they can reduce the coupling of RF signals like bluetooth."

4258,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,Sam Levin,$550 for a pair of headphones like that is heavy overpricing. The top of the line Sony headphones cost at most $350 and they are def better than Apple's headphones. Apple isn't known for making top-notch over-ear headphones. Sony and Bose are known for that stuff so I suggest you go to those companies to buy your over-ear headphones if you want to get some quality headphones. $550 is not worth it even if they are insane awesome best ever headphones ever. Most likely you won't even notice the difference with a pair of $300 headphones

4275,144,AirPods Max Review: Luxury Listening!,2020-12-15,7744762,282676,Sam N,"Serious question - what's the deal with the metal build? does it actually serve some function that would not be achievable with plastic or other materials? Or are they just appealing to the ""premium feel"" crowd? If the latter, I think that's ridiculous. First off, I don't understand what ""feels"" so ""premium"" about metal. Durability? Plastic products are often more durable than their metal counterparts. Plus, some metal scratches easily (Apple knows this well). So why use metal? People say ""these are expensive because they're made from 'premium' materials."" To what benefit? Are they made from more expensive materials strictly so the owner can feel fancy? Whereas they could have been made at a more reasonable price point if not for the need to feed egos? If it was a matter of a $20 difference or something, then it wouldn't seem so strange. But we're talking about headphones that cost more than a next gen console, presumably, in part, because of the ""premium feel"" thing. This makes no sense to me."

But the electronic store down the street with 6 employees needs to stay closed cause we need to slow the spread and save lives. Remember everyone, we are all in this together!?

Translation: I am MKBHD and Apple gave me (and some other Youtube influencers) a couple of free AirPods Max so that I can give them a favorable review. I want to remain objective and maintain my credibility with y‚Äôall so I will only attack the least important thing with these headphones which is the case. I won‚Äôt criticize the outrageous $550 price tag for some Beta debut headphones. It‚Äôs only more than twice as much as the top headphones in this luxury headphones market - Bose and Sony. I won‚Äôt criticize the inferior sound quality that you are supposed to expect from Apple since they‚Äôve never been a sound company. Sound quality is only the most important thing here but I will rant about what to Do for some local higher bitrate at (

There are many categories, I was expecting a consumer oriented product and that is what they produced. I had also expected to like it as I have a thing for earphones and Apple have a good track record with design.  Instead I really dislike it, I particularly detest the headband and my eyes go straight to it whenever I see the headphone. With a modified headband, 3rd party ear pads from ZMF or Dekoni and some way of covering the big aluminum surfaces of the earcups, like a stick on protective and decorative film or even a paint job and I might be tempted.

The only downside is the case which is just an overly complicated replacement for a power button and has been done better by pretty much every other pair of headphones like ever, and only even is a thing because of apples think different mentality. Oh and also the metal which is only there because apple wanted to look more premium than all the other headphones.

I would maybe go $499USD (which comes out to about $640CAD if Applr actually stayed at that conversion) at the most and even then I think $399-$449 would be the most readable and accessible price.

Also we dont know the long term durability of the mesh head bands so for all we know in a years time you might start to see pulls / tears in the fabric and then have to pay an obsene amount of money for a new band. In conclusion yet again apple have brought out a product for no other reason than to make a quick cash grab."

I‚Äôm the type of person to give these a chance. I cannot ignore the idiotic, moronic case and the pathetic battery performance compared to the Sony XM4s. Not to mention the lack of being able to fold down. It‚Äôs a shame. I love the design for sound and the removable ear cups. There‚Äôs just way too much apple BS for that price tag. For sound I‚Äôd take the THX Pandas, for usability the XM4s. I‚Äôd much rather have both of those for under 700 than 550 for only this. A much better excessive way to spend your money. Sometimes the correct response to these products, that America seems to have forgotten, is screw Apple. At $400 these would be a much more reasonable buy. $550 is ridiculous."

No Sony folding gymnastics.  Many times near the end of a long-red eye flight where they haven't turned up the lights yet, I have spent minutes struggling to fold the Sony's correctly and put them back in their case, which I then pack in my carrying luggage, since they have not carrying handles.  With Apple, you just slip then in your purse and go. Last night I got out a number of brief cases and carry-on luggage and packed/unpacked the Sony and Apple in the different bags, trying to image traveling again. Turns out the Apples are about 1 cm slimmer, so more readily slip into outside pockets of luggage if you decide not the carry the Apple purse.  Also, imaging the transition from lounge to aircraft, the handle on the Apples make them easy to grab and go, and quickly slip on and off."

$550, horrible value ratio, but then again these were never meant to be good value. It's another super-premium-luxury-high-end product from Apple. They are priced at that sweetspot again, make as much money as they can, but not too high to turn consumers away. Typical Apple. And long behold, they are sold out till march 2021 every colour variant. If anything, they probably could've put them out for $599, and still would be sold out."

There's an auto-sensor that knows when it's not on your head, but they NEED the case to go into ultra-low power mode or whatever? Why not just have them go into the power saving mode if they're not on your head for like, 5 minutes or something. (or even have it be a setting you can set, like on every computer in the world). That's WEIRD.
Thanks for the review, except for that one very big oversight, I'd be much more interested in buying them. I'll wait until the third generation, like every other apple Product I've bought haha."

The H95's have a lot of similarities: magnetic ear pads, and all metal design. However, the H95's take it beyond by allowing touch controls on the right ear cup, combined with the two dials on each ear cup for volume and ANC/Transparency mode.

I suppose it's nice there is a part on this item that can be replaced easily. It's really awesome for Apple products. I don't think it's ground breaking. I have concerns about the head band durability. I suppose if your budget for headphones is around 500 dollars you might consider this. Enjoy these if you like em. I'd personally save a bit of money and get the XM4's. I feel this is a big proof that there are a lot of fanboys with money.

Look at pricing for smartphones and computers and pricing constantly increasing after Apple prices jump.  Are their component prices jumping that much no, but prices leap up.    Steve Jobs was a market and business person and the two things he loved since he and Woz created the Apple I was big profit margins and closed systems.   Even when Apple was having trouble they had the BOM down and could of built marketshare by lowering prices, but Jobs said nope rather have big profit margins.    So  Apple has done a disservice to the public with their inflated prices that leads to the whole markets going up and up.   The consumers lose in the long run."

I could already guess what you said about the sound quality in the high-end area. I've already seen some videos in which the Youtubers were totally enthusiastic. However, my impression was also that these people had never heard headphones over $ 300 before. Apart from Apple Music and Spotify, nothing else was heard there. In this price range I would rather do without the nice features from Apple and rely on real high-end headphones. If only because I can hear differences in the source material in significantly cheaper devices.  I think it's good that you said at the beginning that other people are much more familiar with the audio field.  Thanks for your test! "

It makes sense at $250 for a great mobile experience, but at close to 600 after taxes, you really are going to be satisfied with  1/3 of the quality of current Bluetooth technology? Apple really will have to create this market and I don‚Äôt see it happening. Imagine the value you can get for $600 if you want to optimize sound quality outside of the apple mobile ecosystem.

But I suspect some 3rd party will make a better solution - let's face it, it's just a strategically placed magnet that is needed. Having said that, I think I would mostly be using them at home with my computer... but I love my Audio-Technica headphones, which are way cheaper, so frankly, unless I bag a set as a gift, I'll probably pass on these... If I'm going to pay 6000 Swedish Kronor for headphones, I'll invest in something studio quality.

The bra case, the price, the extra weight, the multi pair, the design vs XM4(can we all just admit we like the Sony design more?), the need to buy a seperate jack adaptor? The highly overpriced earcups and missing a power button or gestures on the side, higher battery life of XM4. Marques, you really had the chance to put Apple on the spot here and say the thing everybody online was hoping you would say. This piece of tech is simply overpriced and doesn't compete with the current champ in every aspect. The only thing they have going for is the brand(name), ecosystem and the niche of people who like this design. You should not recommend this to anyone and that is a fact. The XM4's are already expensive but still half the price of these but better."

For only a fraction of the cost one can purchase studio quality wireless headphones.

I guess Apple can justify it by saying you can apply for the Apple card and do the monthly installments to make it more affordable. I think they‚Äôre going to force themselves to lower the price like that they did with the first HomePod.

I have the Sony XM3 and am quite happy with them, but if I did not have them and were looking for a new set I would still get them over the Apple because of the price and all the extra things you have to go through to get them to work, i.e. charging, on/off, case....  It is too bad Apple has gone the high-end Boutique route so many of their product rather the high end functionality."

There's so much about this review that irks me the more I listen. :/ You should NOT have to pay $550 for something that barely competes with a $300ish dollar mainstream solution like the XM4s. THAT price range is where you'll find hi-fi options not just for studio monitoring, but stuff that's plain fun to listen to, stuff where you WOULD expect to play those high quality local files, and where you wouldn't just ""catch a bit of sub bass every now and then"".

The actual hi-end headphones like your hd820s focus on the tune of the sound, they can make a piece of music sound great to you because they are tuned. Same thing with in-ear monitors.

I would clarify that for those who can afford both, AirPods Max still pairs nicely with a setup like that, since there‚Äôs less difference in quality between when you use that setup and when you just grab a pair of wireless headphones to watch/listen to something on your phone. I have a setup sort of in that direction on my computer, but I‚Äôve been just using my AirPods Pro for Apple TV, phone, iPad, etc. With AirPods Max there‚Äôs now a much smaller difference in quality between those two setups (plus I no longer have to stop watching a show halfway through an episode because my AirPods died)."

But the only difference and the most important one is that for the price of the AirPods Max u can get a decent headphone AMP,  portable even (iFi Audio xCAN) or a decent DAC (FIIO K10) and a super decent pair of headphones that sound beyond godlike (Beyerdynamic DT770 PRO 80ohm version) and you still have money to spare. That's the whole point! You pay for the brand, the gimmicks, the ... materials ... but ... I don't really see the sound in these worth that price! At all! Compare the gimmick level with the other consumer friendly daily user airplane travelers mall walkers bus riders headphones, BOSE, Sony ... whatever! But just don't touch the sound department at that price because it's a lost battle from the start. Bottom line is ... if you want sound quality, real sound quality ... you can get it at half the price. And this is coming from an Apple environment user (this is for all that will jump at my throat for being an Apple hater which I am not). Be safe guys."

Good point about the replaceable ear cups, but I imagine the mesh headband will age pretty poorly (especially the lighter color) and that can't be replaced.

All you need is an app that doesn't compress that much the sound (Tidal, deezer both offer Hi-fi, quobuz as well) but most importantly the hardaware you're using must be compatible with a bluetooth codec that offers a much better sound quality.

I have an interrogation you might be able to answer.
I‚Äôm an iPhone user myself and I have the Sony XM3. As soon as Amazon Music HD was available in France I subscribed. Unfortunately the HD bitrate is only available through the Lightning/jack port on iPhone and not through Bluetooth since iPhones are only providing SBC level of wireless transmission.

Your production quality keeps me coming back to your channel but your content has become too cookie-cutter recently (coming from an old subscriber)."

One of the main reasons for brands to come with cheap phones is that they finally listened to people like me: I don't need a top camera that also happens to be working as a Phone. I want a great phone that does all I need, and it can take pretty decent pictures when I want to take one. That's why I am still working with the Xiaomi ;-) Pocophone F1, that I bought here in Belgium for 325,35 Euro (395 USD) little over two years ago. I must admit that I am still amazed of what this phone can do, even today. I used to have flagship phones before, but I will never go back to that. Why would I, having the latest MIUI 12 and Android 10 QKQ1 as well??? OK, the battery is not what it used to be, but still I'm very happy with my phone.

After nearly six years, my P9 lite still looks the same when it was bought and performs the same way slightly bit slower due to the load of apps and background services, but not like those other ""samsung"" budget phones lag (which are un-usable), not to mention the battery still running a full day, believe me guys. Based on that, I believe that P9 lite is one of the best budget phones ever made. Anyway, now I daily drive a POCO M3 128 Gig version and I have not still faced any difficulty using this. Obviously, I should not compare this thing with my brother's Samsung Note 10, or an S21 [ ""0_o"" ] DUH! Still this is a great piece."

One is that you'll get one more camera (which is redundant tbh) and the option to get with 6Gb of RAM. Mine is the 6Gb version. No lag so far. The experience is pretty smooth.

Anyways, I love the fact Poco is stepping in to fill the big shoes Oneplus left, I just love it when companies try their best to innovate and not only to the premium high end market but to the people who buy phones with less money but who still want a great phone. I'm getting a M3, won it of Poco themselves üòÅ so veeeery curious when it'll get here. I'm gonna try it out for myself (and my sweet viewers) and after that I think my mom will love a new phone after years with my old Moto Z Play. But who knows maybe I'll decide I want to give her a better phone after using it. Maybe I think this is THE phone for her, can't wait to find out and to get back to your question, I love the way the market is changing.

OnePlus had quite a heavy emphasis on the SOC, amount of RAM and other specs, hence why they have gone up in price. Poco has plenty more emphasis on the very low price tag, with only a couple of noteworthy specs. As much as it is nice that the lower end of the market is being serviced by more brands, they cut costs in some areas which don't make sense, and spend extra where it doesn't count e.g. having more lenses of poor quality. For most people, going this low in price does not make sense, in addition to the fact that these lower prices are only available in certain regions."

Back in the day, OnePlus was able to succeed since it provided great software (near stock Android with valuable upgrades) for a significantly lower cost. But this seems to be a void in the market that most of these other phones are unable to fill and mainly due to software. What are the options for those looking for top notch quality and good software at a discount? Should people buy the 7 or 7t that come a great discounts?"

And I think you forget to mention it's stereo speakers too. This phone is really good value. It's enough to fiction as a text messaging, phone call, picture snapping and light social media surfing device."

Gone were the promises that it would be only using AMOLED screens, focus on flagship line only, now it's just going down the same path as OPPO.

The thing is, these phones won't last you more than a year. So if you're into upgrading your phone every year or so, $129 for a decent spec lower-tier smartphone that doesn't scream super cheap, may be well worth the shot. But again, do expect to change phones or until you upgrade to mid-tier/flagship level. I have been using LG V30 (bought at $500) for 3 years now and this thing still runs so my annual cost so far is $167/year. It feels quite weird to not be able to upgrade a still working but old-ish phone. I feel like the question of durability, update support and future-proofing should be addressed when it comes to these cheap phones."

I owned the Oneplus One, 2, 3 and 7 Pro, all fantastic phones. But the Oneplus One was something special. It gave top of the line specs and a great software experience based off the then CyanogenMod, for such a low price. And then it also allowed incredibly easy modifications through tutorials that Oneplus themselves were approving. Oneplus, at least back then, wanted to give people a power user phone without the premium price tag, and I think they achieved that. POCO on the other hand I feel isn't going down the same path. There is no denying that this new POCO phone is a decent phone for the price that it is offered at, but you are absolutely getting what you pay for. It isn't trying to be a new cheap power user phone that offers incredible specs for a low price, it is simply a cheap phone that is decent enough for the price, which is of course completely ok. Oneplus have certainly left their roots behind, but I don't think POCO is filling the void they left"

I guess the way You handled it is OK, but in essence I feel that it should at least be ""strongly emphasised when a price (or configuration or what ever else is ""time limited"") is just that... A time limited ""Marketing Campaign"",!! And in the rest of the ""review/demo"" it should be treated  and ""called out"" as a product of it's ""full price/normal configuration"". And in cases that information is unavailable at the time, then You should simply say that the ""price/configuration"" unknown at the time of this review...Because that is the reality of it. And """"""reviewers"""""" who knowingly ignore pointing out that a the price/configuration they are """"""reviewing"""""" is not the ""normal"" have simply accepted that they are no longer reviewers but simply a part of the marketing campaign for the products they are ""showing off""."

It is only Snapdragon 732G and doesn‚Äôt have 5G but here in the Philippines, currently, who cares about 5G? It is the phone that both filled the shoes of what was Oneplus 1 or 2 and Nexus 6P. Low price, good specs though UI is not the best. Still, after I install Google Cam, I find the images it take to be very good with decent dynamic range and above average sharpness. So, can that be a daily driver? For most people in our country, the answer is yes. It depends upon the economy we are living if can we avail just these decent phones or can we go to the max spec phones. End of the day, it is our usage that is most important than having all these crazy specs but we cannot use at the moment."

I am not a playstation enthusiast myself. I am an international engineering student here in Canada. I volunteered for a while in a orphanage back in my home country before coming here. I wanted to donate a PS5 to the kids there with my own first income money because due to covid they have no place to play outside. I am leaving for my country next month first week. Can you please help me get a PS5 cd version before that with two controllers? I will pay you in full even if it's open box. I know as a reviewer u might have couple of these consoles.

Honestly though, the absolute high end isn't necessary. I'd be fine with a Pixel 4a and an iPhone SE. I can afford better, so I buy what's in my budget (no crazy $2000 flipping phones for me) but I'd be fine in the mid range. The super low end ones would probably get on my nerves, though, just because I've had the mid to high end ones since my first smartphone (iPhone 4 in 2011). Cheaper phones are better than they've ever been, though. I think that low mid price range where you've got phones like the OnePlus Nord, Pixel 3a, iPhone SE, and other things like that for 400ish is where the most value for price is, for your average user."

If you see other phones their headphone jack is on the bottom left near the charging port and if you try to play some games it obstruct your hand to handle the phone easily. You need to rotate your phone to have that. Unlike the POCO M3 where the headphone jack is near on the camera and if you play games... boom it is exactly right passing to your finger and you achieve the comfortability that I'm talking about. So this is the best budget phone so far.

I could just go and start a company and make a $10 phone which is just a piece of plastic with an LED, would you make a video about that? And either way, you literally said that it usually isn't $129, and it's more, but I'm sure that I could find even a 2019 flagship for that cheap if I looked really hard, so I could call the Note10+ a $100 phone, even though it's actually $949."

What intrigued me about the m1 version, is that I viewed the chipset as what is in their iPad and iPhone, both of those devices both are run by chips that are designed by Apple and both those devices run awesomely. Both of those devices operate so well and efficiently than I have in the past tried to use the iPad as my EDC but fell short because the apps for the iPad are not as full-featured as their desktop counterparts; So really the only thing missing was the waiting for Apple to finally release a laptop with their own chipset.

The last iPhone that I had was the iPhone 4 around 2011 and to be honest, I didn't stay with iPhones mainly because of their price and because you can really find some fine android phones for less money. The issue for me lately was that phones seemed to get bigger and bigger if you want to have the most up-to-date stuff but when I saw the 12 mini in a store, I saw was I was looking for these couple of years. A really good phone, easy to carry and handle, nice camera, nice screen, and it just looks good."

I first had the iPhone 5s and then I upgraded to the iPhone SE (2016 model) in 2017. In any case, I held off on purchasing a new iPhone for three years because one hand typing and portability were exceedingly important to me in a smart phone. It‚Äôs so nice to be able to hold a cup of Starbucks coffee in one hand, while typing a message with the other hand. Convenience like that is pretty much lost on larger, phablet sized phones. That said, I recently upgraded to the 12 mini (product red, to support COVID relief efforts) and I‚Äôm pretty happy with it. I can reach all parts of the screen with my thumb and one-hand typing is still comfortable. Although, I still believe that the 5s/SE was the perfect size for a compact phone. I would love for Apple to offer that form-factor again. As for the battery life on the 12 Mini, I always carry around an external battery  and a fast charger, anyway."

I took my iPhone SE (2020) out of its case and the mini fits completely within the front panel of the SE. A lot of my coworkers have the original SE as their work phone so I‚Äôm anxious to see the size difference between those two phones.

The dealbreakers are: Battery life, and notch ratio on the smaller phone. I like the convenience to pocket it, and accessories to protect it. It is a solid looking phone compared to the previous versions. The reduced bezels gives it a better viewing experience.

For all my purchases this is a huge consideration. My friend buys $200 phone almost every year. This is very comparable to iPhones if you take into consideration their eligibility for updates and resell value after 4-5 years. What are your thoughts on this approach to purchasing decision?"

Also, as an amateur photographer I‚Äôve turned to using the iPhone more and more when I don‚Äôt feel like dragging my DSLRs along with me on hiking trips, MTB/road bike rides, or just day to day generally. I know the iPhone will never (at least not anytime soon) match the quality of photos from a ‚Äúreal‚Äù camera, but for what it is, it‚Äôs pretty amazing. With this I use a lot of storage space.

I really love to take good pictures from my iPhone X, there are a lot of good scenery here where I live in Boston. But that same good experience showed me that there is a big limit of what the iPhone X camera can do, specially for long distance shots and low light. So, it made sense for me to update to the new iPhone 12 Pro; it main selling feature is that new camera lenses. But at the same time I discovered about the mirrorless cameras that have been around for a few, they have gotten pretty good dealing with those same issues, have gotten cheaper and smaller. If you are like me looking for a better picture shooting experience, want better pics or just good scenery shoots to put in your Instagram the iPhone camera will ALWAYS underperform when you compare it with those cameras. And the main issue actually, is the price, you can get a very good mirrorless camera from a good brand like Canon, Sony or Nikon and they will be cheaper that this iPhone. And if you are like me, is very frustrating when you have the idea of this perfect pic in your mind and the iPhone camera don't delivers, and it never will. For this price range you can make the sacrifice of staying with your old iPhone for a bit more and put this investment towards a good camera (even a good point and shoot), having an extra gadget will be worth it."

Here are few pointers that I noted in using pixel5 with ATT for two weeks.  Cons : 1) Its need a hardware update for sure , watching tiktok or playing a game for 60 mins make the phone hot ball.  Same is case when I am setting up the phone initially and copying data from old pixel to new. 2) Post clicking a camera it's asking me to hold still for almost 5 to 10 sec , specifically on night or portrait mode. Processing of picture immediately after clicking is also lagging.   Pros : 1) camera clicks are real amazing  2) perfect hand fit  3) Display is really good and with great battery."

But I would say it's not an iPad Pro killer when you use it heavily for illustration. In that case the difference in for example how many layers you can get in Procreate, is really important.

Tip: You can speed up the swivel animation on the main screen by changing the transition animation scale from 1.0 to 0.5 or off in the developer options. It changes instantly on my Wing."

The features are so unique and so out-of-the box that it surely takes some time getting used to it but once you get the hang of it, there is certainly no going back.

The third gen Pixel devices showed they're strong in the budget device arena, and people will look elsewhere for a premium phone. If the world was less crazy right now I'd say maybe they shouldn't give up on the bleeding edge specs, but any manufacturer that isn't considering the lower and mid end consumers right now will find themselves in trouble going forward."
